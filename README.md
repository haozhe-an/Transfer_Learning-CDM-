# Transfer_Learning_CDM
This repository contains a naive implementation of transfer learning using conditional distribution matching approach as described in "Active Transfer Learning under Model Shift" by Xuezhi Wang et al.
The graphs illustrate the current prediction results. This is an ongoing project, so they don't reflect the final accuracy of the model.
